    <h1>Alpha Run Club</h1>

    <p>
      Alpha Run Club is where movement dissolves resistance and brings you back to yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      We run, train, and gather not to perform, but to feel alive again, together.
    </p>
   
    <p>
  We meet every Sunday and run across different parts of Pune. The place changes. The rhythm stays.
