     <h1>Events</h1>

  <p>
    Alpha events are moments of shared effort.
    Some are simple weekly runs.
    Some are intense, like Alpha Arena.

    <h2>Weekly Runs</h2>
    <p>
    We meet every Sunday and run across different parts of Pune.
    The location changes, but the intention stays the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some weeks are quiet.
    Some are intense.
    You come as you are and move at your own pace.

  <section>
    <h2>Alpha Arena</h2>
    <p>
      A special event built around challenge, play, and celebration.
      An arena where effort is visible and community is felt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alpha Arena is not about winning.
      It is about meeting resistance and moving through it together.

    If something is happening, you’ll hear about it.
    Until then, keep moving.
