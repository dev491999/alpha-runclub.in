     <h1>Why Alpha Exists</h1>

  <p>
    Alpha was not created to build a club, a brand, or a following.
  </p>

  <p>
    It emerged from a simple observation, people move through life
    disconnected from their bodies, their breath, and each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Running became the excuse. Movement became the doorway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alpha exists to create spaces where effort is honest,
    presence matters more than performance,
    and community forms naturally through shared movement.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no pressure to be fast.
    No pressure to become anything.
  </p>

    You show up. You move. That is enough.
