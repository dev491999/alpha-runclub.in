    <h1>Community</h1>

  <p>
    Alpha is shaped by the people who show up.
    Not by followers, not by numbers, but by shared effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conversations happen while warming up.
    Bonds form while catching breath.
    Silence is shared after hard runs.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no audience here.
    Only participants.
  </p>

    <h2>Moments</h2>
    <p>
      Photos and reflections will appear here over time.
      Not everything needs to be documented.

    <p>“I came for a run. I stayed for how it made me feel afterward.”</p>
    <p>“No one cared how fast I was. That changed everything.”</p>
    <p>“It felt simple. And that’s what made it powerful.”</p>
